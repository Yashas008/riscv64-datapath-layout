# riscv64-datapath-layout
 Analog custom layout of a 64-bit RISC-V datapath using Cadence Virtuoso
# RISC-V 64-Bit Datapath ‚Äì Full-Custom Analog Layout (GPDK090)

This repository contains the    GDSII layout files    for selected full-custom standard cells designed using    Cadence Virtuoso IC615    with the    GPDK090 90nm CMOS process   . These cells will be used as part of a larger effort to construct a custom    64-bit RISC-V datapath   , including logic blocks such as ALUs, registers, and control logic.

All cells are verified using    Assura DRC and LVS   , and exported as clean GDSII files viewable using KLayout or other tools.



   üß† Project Goals

- Create a full-custom analog layout of fundamental logic blocks.
- Build up from    basic gates    (Inverter, NOR) to complex datapath components.
- Verify all cells through    DRC    and    LVS   .
- Simulate pre/post-layout designs using    HSPICE or Spectre   .
- Export clean    GDSII    layout for documentation and hierarchical integration.

   üîß Tools & Environment

| Tool            | Version / Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Cadence Virtuoso | IC6.1.5 (32-bit) |
| Assura DRC & LVS | For rule checking and netlist verification |

   ‚úÖ Verification Summary

| Cell     | DRC | LVS | GDS Export | Notes |
|----------|-----|-----|------------|-------|
| Inverter | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ         | Clean and minimal |
| NOR      | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ         | Ready for datapath use |

I do plan on pasting the entirety of the library here once I have completely done the processor.

üéØ Current Focus

This phase of the project focuses on:
 Building custom layout blocks for a 64-bit RISC-V datapath
 Understanding and resolving DRC, LVS, and RCX errors
 Mastering Cadence Virtuoso workflows
 GDS export and documentation

Testbenches and simulation infrastructure will be added in later stages.
